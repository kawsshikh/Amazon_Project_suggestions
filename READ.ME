ðŸ›’ Amazon Product Query Extractor

This project uses a fine-tuned **BERT NER model** and a **FastAPI** interface to:
- Extract structured product search intent from natural queries
- Scrape Amazon product suggestions based on parsed fields
- Rank and filter products using smart heuristics (e.g., rating, sales, sponsorship)
