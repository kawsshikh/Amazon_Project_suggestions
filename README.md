# 🛍️ Amazon Product Intent Extractor

This project leverages a **fine-tuned BERT NER model** and a **FastAPI** backend to create an intelligent product query system. It converts free-form user input into structured queries, scrapes Amazon using **Playwright**, and returns ranked product suggestions in an interactive HTML interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 **Natural Language Input Form**  
  Interactive HTML form using FastAPI (`GET`) to collect user queries like:  
  _"Show me 5 noise-canceling headphones rated above 4.3 that are not sponsored."_

- 🤖 **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Extracts structured product intent from the query using a fine-tuned **BERT model**, including:
  - Product name  
  - Minimum rating  
  - Number of results requested  
  - Sponsorship preference

- 🌐 **Amazon Scraping with Playwright**  
  Automates browsing and extracts live product listings from Amazon.

- 🧠 **Smart Ranking & Filtering**  
  Uses heuristics to sort and prioritize relevant products (e.g., rating, sponsored status, reviews).
