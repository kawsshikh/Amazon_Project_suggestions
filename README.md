# 🛍️ Amazon Product Intent Extractor

This project leverages a **fine-tuned BERT NER model** and a **FastAPI** backend to create an intelligent product query system. It converts free-form user input into structured queries, scrapes Amazon using **Playwright**, and returns ranked product suggestions in an interactive HTML interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 **Natural Language Input Form**  
  Interactive HTML form using FastAPI (`GET`) to collect user queries like:  
  _"Show me 5 noise-canceling headphones rated above 4.3 that are not sponsored."_

- 🤖 **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Extracts structured product intent from the query using a fine-tuned **BERT model**, including:
  - Product name  
  - Minimum rating  
  - Number of results requested  
  - Sponsorship preference

- 🌐 **Amazon Scraping with Playwright**  
  Automates browsing and extracts live product listings from Amazon.

- 🧠 **Smart Ranking & Filtering**  
  Uses heuristics to sort and prioritize relevant products (e.g., rating, sponsored status, reviews).

🛠️ Installation Instructions for Amazon Product Intent Extractor

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:


🔹 **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kawsshikh/Amazon_Project_suggestions.git
cd Amazon_Project_suggestions
```



🔹 **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

- **On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- **On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```



🔹 **Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



🔹 **Install Playwright and Its Dependencies**
```bash
python -m playwright install
```

> This installs the necessary browser binaries for scraping.



🔹 **(Optional) Train the BERT NER Model**
```bash
python -m first_run
```

> Skip if you already have a trained model saved in `./ner-model`.



🔹 **Run the FastAPI Application**
```bash
python -m run
```

Then open your browser and go to:

## 🧠 How It Works
```markdown


1. User Input (Free-Form Text):
   - You enter a natural query like:
     _"Find me 5 green tea powders rated above 4 stars and not sponsored"_

2. **NER Model Extraction:**
   - The BERT-based NER model extracts:
     - query: `green tea powder`
     - stars: `4`
     - limit: `5`
     - sponsored: False    

3. **Playwright Scraper:**
   - Scrapes Amazon for real product listings using headless browsing.

4. **Heuristics Engine:**
   - filters and sorts the data according to the user's preference

5. **Result Display:**
   - FastAPI renders the HTML with product name, rating, reviews, price, etc.
```

## 📽 Demo
🔹 **Query obtained as Input from FastAPI GET**
  - list non sponsored seven Harry Potter lego sets with at least 4.5 star rating.

🔹 **ETL - NER**
 - detects "Harry Potter lego set" as query
 - detects seven as number of suggestions -> converts str to int
 - rating as 4.5
 - sponsor is flagged false
 - constructs a JSON


🔹 **Web Scraping using Plawright**
- Gathers the query
- transforms into a search URL
- transforms the HTML content to DataFrame
- apply filter and sort


 🔹 **Output sent through FastAPI POST**
- Gathered output is passed to users via FastAPI Post
